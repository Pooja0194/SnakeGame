		Use the keyboard arrows to move the hungry snake around.
		The speed of the snake as well as its size increases after eating every slice of 🍕!

		<!-- <u>Logic</u>:

			*) If the ball is too close to the border it will automatically stick to it.
			*) If the ball is too far from the border it will speed up. -->
