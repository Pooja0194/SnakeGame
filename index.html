<p>
	Press start and eat as many pizzas as you can. <span>&#x1F355;</span>!
	<p>            <u>Tutorial</u>:<br>
		Use the keyboard arrows to move the hungry snake around.
		The speed of the snake as well as its size increases after eating every slice of 🍕! <br>
		Made with only Vanilla JS by Saurav <a href="https://github.com/sauravabc16"> (sauravabc16)</a>.
	
		<!-- <u>Logic</u>:
			*) If the ball is too close to the border it will change its color to Red.
			*) If the ball is too close to the border it will automatically stick to it.
			*) If the ball is too far from the border it will speed up. -->
